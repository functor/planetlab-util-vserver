Version 0.29
============

	- further compilation fixes

	- adapted the 'vserver ... build' command to the new barrier
	  mechanism

	

Version 0.28
============
	
	- BUGFIX: fixed context creation when both fakeinit-flag and a
	  static context is wanted; previous versions ignored the fakeinit
	  flag in this situation

	- BUGFIX: vserver-copy: autodetect mktemp/tempfile (reported by
	  DUCLOS Andre)

	- FEATURE: allow to override start/stop commands of vservers
	  (patch by Erik Smit)

	- BUGFIX: call 'chkconfig' to fix initscripts *after* generating
	  the configuration (reported by DUCLOS Andre)

	- call programs with 'exec' on vserver's 'suexec' command (patch
	  by Alec Thomas)

	- improved e2fsprogs header detection

	- API-CHANGE: removed argument from vc_get_version() since the
	  only supported category is VC_CAT_COMPAT

	
Version 0.27
============

	- added new 'vkill' implementation which uses the syscall from
	  vserver 1.1.6+.
	
	- BUGFIX: fixed typo in vc_get_version() wrapper which caused an
	  infinite recursive call of this function; this should not have
	  affected any userspace program

	- BUGFIX: 'vps' accepts multiple arguments now (from Debian patch)

	- vc_ctx_kill() was added
	
	- chrootsafe() code was removed since such a functionality seems
	  to be impossible

	- use 'vserver' instead of 'virtual_context' as the syscall name;
	  this will fix problems with architectures where the syscall is not
	  at #273.

	- BUGFIX: fixed '--enable-apis' ./configure option; formerly, only
	  'ALL' or none were possible

	- moved some old, unused programs/scripts into a seperate 'legacy'/
	  directory

	- BUGFIX: /dev/pts will be mounted with correct options now

	- added support for Slackware's init-method (thanks to Stephen
	  Pearce for the patch)

	- API-CHANGE: followed kernel patches and renamed 'ctx_t' datatype
	  to 'xid_t'.


Version 0.26
============

	- BUGFIX: uninitialized variables in 'ifspec' were fixed and
	  error-messages will be given out when ioctl() on the requested
	  interface fails (thanks to Herbert Poetzl)
	
	- BUGFIX: fixed vc_get_rlimit_mask() to return the queried
	  values. This step was missing in 0.25 which returned the
	  error-code only.
	
	- use the shipped 'virtual.h' header on default instead of the
	  kernel version. The old Behavior can be restored with the
	  '--disable-internal-headers' ./configure option
	

Version 0.25
============

	- BUGFIX: this version fixes handling of ctx >= 32768

	- experimental support for new resource-limit syscall was add
	  (vserver >= 1.1.3); the new 'vlimit' tool replaces 'setctxlimit'

	- some man-pages were added and init-scripts improved (taken from
	  Debian patches provided by Sam Vilain)

	- basic Gentoo support was added to the 'vserver' script (thanks to
	  "Allen D. Parker II")

	- compilation fixes for kernel 2.6 headers

	- set mode/owner of /var/run/utmp (owner is customizable through
	  $UTMP_GROUP)

	
Version 0.24
============

	- updated to new syscall API (patch c17h and later)
	
	- revived copy-all-mode for 'vserver ... build' (can be disabled
	  with $UTIL_VSERVER_AVOID_COPY)

	- use '-HS' ulimit switch for newly created vservers

	- added QUOTACTL capability, removed OPENDEV capability

	- location of vservers-rootdir can now be configured through a
	  '--with-vrootdir' configure switch; it defaults still to
	  '/vservers'

	- build of 'newvserver' linuxconf-module is conditionalized since
	  it is unsupported and will be dropped in future versions. To
	  enable it. call './configure' with '--enable-linuxconf'.
	
	
version 0.23.6
==============

	- fixed '--level' option on 'vserver ... chkconfig'
