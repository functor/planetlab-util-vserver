version 0.30.213
================
	- added support for the device mapping feature present in development
	kernels.

	- further improved Gentoo support, again thanks to Benedikt Böhm.

	- support persistent contexts.

	- add another initscript that creates directories, configures vshelper
	as well as kills all contexts.

	- new vserver-stat implementation, which uses the accounting APIs
	available in Linux-VServer 2.2.

	- added support for setting sysctl values in the guest configuration.

	- added a clone build method, which simply links already unified files.

	- implement dynamic contexts in userspace, generating a static one
	during vserver ... build.

	- fix the endless loop in vlogin.

	- fix Ubuntu builds.

	- improved support for Debian Etch, thanks to Benedikt Böhm.

	- added CentOS 5.

	- use the state change helper to try to cleanup after us if the guest
	exited on its own.

version 0.30.212
================
	- support for the Linux-VServer 2.1 API has been implemented.

	- the scheduler configuration has been split up into multiple files.

	- namespace cleanup is enabled by default. This can be disabled by
	touch ${sysconfdir}/vservers/.defaults/nonamespace-cleanup

	- all unset ulimits are now reset to infinity, so limits are no longer
	inherited from the host.

	- much improved Gentoo support, thanks to Benedikt Böhm.

version 0.30.211
================

	- novlandev is now the default. To reenable the old behaviour of
	creating VLAN interfaces where used, touch
	${sysconfdir}/vservers/.defaults/interfaces/vlandev.

	- vshelper now works correctly with the kernel legacy support turned
	off.

	- vlogin provides a terminal proxy which allocates a new psuedo-tty
	on the inside when you enter a guest.

	- and lots of other features/fixes, see ChangeLog.


version 0.30.210
================

	- LEGACY BREAKAGE: by default, only recent kernel APIs will be
	supported so you have to make sure to use at least the vs2.0.1
	kernel patch. With older kernels, you have to call 'configure'
	with '--enable-apis=NOLEGACY'. Some programs will not work anymore
	with the default settings; these ones are:

	     + capchroot
	     * chcontext-context
	     * reducecap

	- dlimit support was integrated into the standard vserver
	operations. Thanks to Daniel Hokka Zakrisson for his patch.

	- recent kernel API is now used for setting up the network
	contexts. So it should be now possible to use a kernel compiled
	without CONFIG_VSERVER_LEGACYNET. Thanks to Daniel Hokka Zakrisson
	for his patch.  .


version 0.30.209
================

	- large revamping...
	
	
version 0.23.6
==============

	- fixed '--level' option on 'vserver ... chkconfig'
