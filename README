Build-Requirements:

    * at least gcc-2.95 (C and C++ frontends)

    * when using 2.6 kernel-headers, the 'e2fsprogs' headers are
      required. RHL/Fedora Core ships them in the 'e2fsprogs-devel'
      package, Mandrake in 'libext2fs2-devel'.

      Using these headers with kernel 2.4 will not hurt and can prevent
      problems, so they are strongly recommended.
